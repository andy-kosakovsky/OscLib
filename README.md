# OscLib
An attempt to create a full, free and open-source implementation of [Open Sound Control Protocol](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) as a .Net/Mono library, with an aim towards flexibility, efficiency, ease of use and as little GC pressure as feasibly possible.

Very much **WORK IN PROGRESS** currently - the library's not suitable for anything nearing actual use just yet, and will most likely get broken and rearranged in randomest ways before it is. Also in dire need of proper documentation. For the time being, please refer to [manual.md](https://github.com/andy-kosakovsky/OscLib/blob/dev/OscLib/Source/manual.md#future-osclib-manual) for the basics.
