# OscLib
An attempt to create a full implementation of Open Sound Control protocol in C#/.Net/Mono/whatever, with an aim towards flexibility, efficiency, ease of use and as little GC pressure as feasibly possible.

Follows the [Open Sound Control 1.0 Specification](http://cnmat.org/OpenSoundControl/OSC-spec.html), for the most part.

Very much **WORK IN PROGRESS** - not suitable for anything nearing actual use just yet, and will most likely get broken and rearranged in randomest ways. Also in dire need of proper documentation.
