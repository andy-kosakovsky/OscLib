# OscLib
An attempt to create a full implementation of Open Sound Control protocol in C#/.Net/Mono/whatever, with an aim towards flexibility, ease of use and as little GC pressure as possible.

Follows the [Open Sound Control 1.0 Specification](http://cnmat.org/OpenSoundControl/OSC-spec.html), for the most part.

Very much **WORK IN PROGRESS** - not quite suitable for actual use just yet. Also in dire need of proper documentation.
